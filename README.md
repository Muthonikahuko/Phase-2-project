# Business understanding and problem overview
In this project, I will provide information using regression modeling analysis of house sales data in King County, for real estate agencies to advise homeowners on how renovations and improvements can affect the estimated values of their homes.

# Data understanding
From the ks_house_data.csv the data included records of 21597 houses sold in King County. We noticed that we have 21 columns:
id', 'date', 'price', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'sqft_living',
'sqft_lot', 'floors', 'waterfront', 'view', 'condition', 'grade',
'sqft_above', 'sqft_basement', 'yr_built', 'yr_renovated', 'zipcode',
'lat', 'long', 'sqft_living15', 'sqft_lot1'
We have the id which did not appear relevant at this stage. We also have the price which was our target variable. 
Thirdly we have quality of bedrooms, bathrooms, and floors with a grading system for the properties which contains the condition and grade. We have several dimensions in square foot such as the living arear, lot area, above and the baement. 
We also have the location data by zipcode, latitude, longitude, and distance to the nearest 15 neighbors
Lastly, we have year-built, year renovated, views, and waterfront
